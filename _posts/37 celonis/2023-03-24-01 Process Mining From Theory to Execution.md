Welcome from your hosts, Professor Wil van der Aalst and Rosie from Celonis.

## Welcome from Professor Wil van der Aalst

Hello and Welcome to "Process Mining: From Theory to Execution"! 

We are happy to welcome you to this joint class by RWTH Aachen and Celonis together with the Godfather of Process Mining, Prof. Wil van der Aalst. This course is designed for everyone who wants to gain an advanced theoretical understanding of Process Mining and how the science behind it comes into application in state-of-the-art technology.

Below you can find all the relevant information that will help you navigate through this class and earn your learner's badge at the end! After this you can directly go back to the main navigation page and get started with Lecture 1!

### Topics and Structure

The "Process Mining: From Theory to Execution" class is brought to you by RWTH Aachen and Celonis and led by the Godfather of Process Mining Prof.dr.ir. Wil van der Aalst.

The goal of this class is to get you familiar with the solid theoretical and academic foundation of Process Mining. With this theoretical knowledge, we will guide you further to the practical application of Process Mining with real business cases, data and insider tips from Celonis. After finishing all the lectures in this class you will understand the most important concepts behind Process Mining and the respective software functionalities building on them and what they can be applied for in a business context.

Let's meet your instructors Prof.dr.ir. Wil van der Aalst (you can call him Wil ;)) from RWTH Aachen and Rosie from Celonis!

### Meet your Professor

#### The Godfather of Process Mining

Prof.dr.ir. Wil van der Aalst is a full professor at RWTH Aachen University leading the Process and Data Science (PADS) group. He is also part-time affiliated with the Fraunhofer-Institut für Angewandte Informationstechnik (FIT) where he leads FIT’s Process Mining group and the Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (TU/e). His research interests include Process Mining, Petri Nets, business process management, workflow management, process modeling, and process analysis.

As an academic, Wil is passionate about sharing his knowledge of Process Mining and teaching others. It was one of the motivations behind this class - to provide a learning opportunity bridging the gap between theory and software application and to give you a solid understanding of Process Mining directly by the person who invented it!

We call Wil van der Aalst the Godfather of Process Mining - and there is a good reason for that! Wil has been researching Process Mining for many years in the academic area. Thanks to his work Process Mining found its way into business and built a solid foundation for companies such as Celonis, where Wil holds a position as the Chief Scientific Advisor.

### Meet Celonis

#### Who or what is Celonis?

Celonis is the marketleader for Process Mining and Execution Management Technology facilitating smooth operations for over 2000 enterprises worldwide including 50% of Fortune 500 companies. Celonis has won multiple awards for its outstanding technology including The EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award, the Bain Game Changers Award 2019, 2016 and the German President's Award 2019. By now Celonis is the most valuable start up company in Germany and New York being valued at 11bn US Dollars having earned the rare Decacorn status.

Celonis was founded in 2011 as a student project of three students from the Technical University of Munich. The three founders Bastian Nominacher, Alexander Rinke & Martin Klenk worked on a student consulting project helping the Bavarian Broadcasting service to improve their IT Service Desk answering times when they stumbled across Process Mining as an academic idea and discipline pioneered by Prof. Wil van der Aalst. Not only Process Mining but also Celonis has an inherently academic DNA. Since then Celonis has turned into one of the fastest-growing companies within Europe, now has two headquarters in Munich and New York and has even turned into a Decacorn with over 2000 employees and an evaluation of 11bn US Dollars recently. 

If you want to learn more about Celonis as a Company Check out this article in Forbes telling the story behind the once-in-a-generation company (Forbes, June 2021: https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/06/02/celonis-process-mining-raises-at-11-billion-valuation/?sh=a35a6232acd3(opens in a new tab))

#### The Celonis Execution Management System
    
The Celonis Software is also known as the Celonis Execution Management System (short EMS). The Celonis EMS has Process Mining technology at its core. Just like the field of Process Mining the Celonis EMS has developed from an historical analytical tool towards an action-oriented operational backbone in enterprises. The Celonis EMS now also integrates prediction capabilities as well as action flows and automation capabilities to prevent bottlenecks from happening in real time. 

The Celonis Software includes the chance to upload data from scratch or build direct connectors to source systems (Event Collection), a Celonis Studio to build analyses and integrate Action Flows and a Machine Learning Workbench to run predictions and even import e.g. Python or R packages. 

Throughout the course of the lecture we will get to know all of these features in more detail!

# 02. Overview of the Field and Basic Concepts

Introduction: Process Mining From Theory to Execution

Course | 1h 30min

Introduction to Process Mining and its multiple facets.

Welcome to your first lecture of "Process Mining: From Theory to Execution". In this first Lecture we will start with an Introduction to the main themes currently relevant in Process Mining. The aim of this first lecture unit is to give you an overview of what Process Mining entails and where it currently stands as well as to introduce you to some basic terminologies and concepts that are important for the field.

Just like all of the other lectures this lecture unit contains a theory lecture from Wil, hands-on illustrations in Celonis as well as a knowledge check quiz! Start your Process Mining journey now!

## Lecture 1: Introduction to Themes


"Process Mining is a complex and continually expanding field of study. From its conception as a research topic in the late 90’s it has grown into a globally applied science touching the likes of more than half of fortune 500 companies. "

### Introduction to Themes

Wil van der Aalst pioneered the field of Process Mining in the 1990s. He was the first to investigate the missing link between process and data science. In the first part of this course he will give you an overview of the field and introduce you to important concepts and terminologies.

In this first lecture, Wil will introduce you to the fundamentals of Process Mining and a top-down overview of its structure. You will learn about different tasks in Process Mining and what is needed to accomplish them. Furthermore, after watching this lecture, you will get familiar with the most important attributes of data required for Process Mining: Case, Activity, and Timestamp. By using these types of data, you will not only get valuable insights into the as-is processes, but also will be able to make predictions to optimize processes in the future.

`Hint`: We recommend taking notes and listening actively since there will be quiz questions testing your knowledge!

By now, you should have learned the definition, history, and importance of Process Mining for different businesses. You should also be familiar with the overview and the different focus areas that the field holds: From Process Discovery to action-oriented Process Mining. Now, let's see how you can apply Process Mining in practice together with Celonis - for this, join the hands-on Lecture by Celonis.
