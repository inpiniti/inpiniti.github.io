# Welcome from Professor Wil van der Aalst

Hello and Welcome to "Process Mining: From Theory to Execution"! 

We are happy to welcome you to this joint class by RWTH Aachen and Celonis together with the Godfather of Process Mining, Prof. Wil van der Aalst. This course is designed for everyone who wants to gain an advanced theoretical understanding of Process Mining and how the science behind it comes into application in state-of-the-art technology.

Below you can find all the relevant information that will help you navigate through this class and earn your learner's badge at the end! After this you can directly go back to the main navigation page and get started with Lecture 1!

## Topics and Structure

The "Process Mining: From Theory to Execution" class is brought to you by RWTH Aachen and Celonis and led by the Godfather of Process Mining Prof.dr.ir. Wil van der Aalst.

The goal of this class is to get you familiar with the solid theoretical and academic foundation of Process Mining. With this theoretical knowledge, we will guide you further to the practical application of Process Mining with real business cases, data and insider tips from Celonis. After finishing all the lectures in this class you will understand the most important concepts behind Process Mining and the respective software functionalities building on them and what they can be applied for in a business context.

Let's meet your instructors Prof.dr.ir. Wil van der Aalst (you can call him Wil ;)) from RWTH Aachen and Rosie from Celonis!

### Course Structure

The "Process Mining: From Theory to Execution" class consists of 7 lectures. Each lecture gives you a holistic overview of the topic consisting of three different learning items:

1. Lectures by Wil - here you get familiar with the theoretical side of Process Mining

2. Hands-on Illustration by Celonis - after learning the theory, you are welcome to apply your fresh knowledge in practice by following the practical videos by Celonis

3. Knowledge-Check - each lecture ends with a small quiz to test your knowledge

### What's Next?

After successfully completing the class, you will receive your learner's badge for this class! We work together with Credly to issue internationally recognized learner's certifications.

In order to get your badge, you need to complete the Process Mining journey by watching all the lectures in this class and submitting the knowledge-checks. Most importantly, the class counts as successfully completed if you score 50% and higher in the knowledge-checks.

This badge is issued in the name of RWTH Aachen and Celonis. You may add this digital badge to your CV or your LinkedIn Profile. 

Good luck!

## Meet your Professor

### The Godfather of Process Mining

Prof.dr.ir. Wil van der Aalst is a full professor at RWTH Aachen University leading the Process and Data Science (PADS) group. He is also part-time affiliated with the Fraunhofer-Institut für Angewandte Informationstechnik (FIT) where he leads FIT’s Process Mining group and the Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (TU/e). His research interests include Process Mining, Petri Nets, business process management, workflow management, process modeling, and process analysis.

As an academic, Wil is passionate about sharing his knowledge of Process Mining and teaching others. It was one of the motivations behind this class - to provide a learning opportunity bridging the gap between theory and software application and to give you a solid understanding of Process Mining directly by the person who invented it!

We call Wil van der Aalst the Godfather of Process Mining - and there is a good reason for that! Wil has been researching Process Mining for many years in the academic area. Thanks to his work Process Mining found its way into business and built a solid foundation for companies such as Celonis, where Wil holds a position as the Chief Scientific Advisor.

## Meet Celonis

### Who or what is Celonis?

Celonis is the marketleader for Process Mining and Execution Management Technology facilitating smooth operations for over 2000 enterprises worldwide including 50% of Fortune 500 companies. Celonis has won multiple awards for its outstanding technology including The EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award, the Bain Game Changers Award 2019, 2016 and the German President's Award 2019. By now Celonis is the most valuable start up company in Germany and New York being valued at 11bn US Dollars having earned the rare Decacorn status.

Celonis was founded in 2011 as a student project of three students from the Technical University of Munich. The three founders Bastian Nominacher, Alexander Rinke & Martin Klenk worked on a student consulting project helping the Bavarian Broadcasting service to improve their IT Service Desk answering times when they stumbled across Process Mining as an academic idea and discipline pioneered by Prof. Wil van der Aalst. Not only Process Mining but also Celonis has an inherently academic DNA. Since then Celonis has turned into one of the fastest-growing companies within Europe, now has two headquarters in Munich and New York and has even turned into a Decacorn with over 2000 employees and an evaluation of 11bn US Dollars recently. 

If you want to learn more about Celonis as a Company Check out this article in Forbes telling the story behind the once-in-a-generation company (Forbes, June 2021: https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/06/02/celonis-process-mining-raises-at-11-billion-valuation/?sh=a35a6232acd3(opens in a new tab))

### The Celonis Execution Management System
    
The Celonis Software is also known as the Celonis Execution Management System (short EMS). The Celonis EMS has Process Mining technology at its core. Just like the field of Process Mining the Celonis EMS has developed from an historical analytical tool towards an action-oriented operational backbone in enterprises. The Celonis EMS now also integrates prediction capabilities as well as action flows and automation capabilities to prevent bottlenecks from happening in real time. 

The Celonis Software includes the chance to upload data from scratch or build direct connectors to source systems (Event Collection), a Celonis Studio to build analyses and integrate Action Flows and a Machine Learning Workbench to run predictions and even import e.g. Python or R packages. 

Throughout the course of the lecture we will get to know all of these features in more detail!
