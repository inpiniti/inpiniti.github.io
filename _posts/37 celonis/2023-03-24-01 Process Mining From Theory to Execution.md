### Meet your Professor

#### The Godfather of Process Mining

Prof.dr.ir. Wil van der Aalst is a full professor at RWTH Aachen University leading the Process and Data Science (PADS) group. He is also part-time affiliated with the Fraunhofer-Institut für Angewandte Informationstechnik (FIT) where he leads FIT’s Process Mining group and the Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (TU/e). His research interests include Process Mining, Petri Nets, business process management, workflow management, process modeling, and process analysis.

As an academic, Wil is passionate about sharing his knowledge of Process Mining and teaching others. It was one of the motivations behind this class - to provide a learning opportunity bridging the gap between theory and software application and to give you a solid understanding of Process Mining directly by the person who invented it!

We call Wil van der Aalst the Godfather of Process Mining - and there is a good reason for that! Wil has been researching Process Mining for many years in the academic area. Thanks to his work Process Mining found its way into business and built a solid foundation for companies such as Celonis, where Wil holds a position as the Chief Scientific Advisor.

### Meet Celonis

#### Who or what is Celonis?

Celonis is the marketleader for Process Mining and Execution Management Technology facilitating smooth operations for over 2000 enterprises worldwide including 50% of Fortune 500 companies. Celonis has won multiple awards for its outstanding technology including The EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award, the Bain Game Changers Award 2019, 2016 and the German President's Award 2019. By now Celonis is the most valuable start up company in Germany and New York being valued at 11bn US Dollars having earned the rare Decacorn status.

Celonis was founded in 2011 as a student project of three students from the Technical University of Munich. The three founders Bastian Nominacher, Alexander Rinke & Martin Klenk worked on a student consulting project helping the Bavarian Broadcasting service to improve their IT Service Desk answering times when they stumbled across Process Mining as an academic idea and discipline pioneered by Prof. Wil van der Aalst. Not only Process Mining but also Celonis has an inherently academic DNA. Since then Celonis has turned into one of the fastest-growing companies within Europe, now has two headquarters in Munich and New York and has even turned into a Decacorn with over 2000 employees and an evaluation of 11bn US Dollars recently. 

If you want to learn more about Celonis as a Company Check out this article in Forbes telling the story behind the once-in-a-generation company (Forbes, June 2021: https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/06/02/celonis-process-mining-raises-at-11-billion-valuation/?sh=a35a6232acd3(opens in a new tab))

#### The Celonis Execution Management System
    
The Celonis Software is also known as the Celonis Execution Management System (short EMS). The Celonis EMS has Process Mining technology at its core. Just like the field of Process Mining the Celonis EMS has developed from an historical analytical tool towards an action-oriented operational backbone in enterprises. The Celonis EMS now also integrates prediction capabilities as well as action flows and automation capabilities to prevent bottlenecks from happening in real time. 

The Celonis Software includes the chance to upload data from scratch or build direct connectors to source systems (Event Collection), a Celonis Studio to build analyses and integrate Action Flows and a Machine Learning Workbench to run predictions and even import e.g. Python or R packages. 

Throughout the course of the lecture we will get to know all of these features in more detail!

# 02. Overview of the Field and Basic Concepts

Introduction: Process Mining From Theory to Execution

Course | 1h 30min

Introduction to Process Mining and its multiple facets.

Welcome to your first lecture of "Process Mining: From Theory to Execution". In this first Lecture we will start with an Introduction to the main themes currently relevant in Process Mining. The aim of this first lecture unit is to give you an overview of what Process Mining entails and where it currently stands as well as to introduce you to some basic terminologies and concepts that are important for the field.

Just like all of the other lectures this lecture unit contains a theory lecture from Wil, hands-on illustrations in Celonis as well as a knowledge check quiz! Start your Process Mining journey now!

## Lecture 1: Introduction to Themes


"Process Mining is a complex and continually expanding field of study. From its conception as a research topic in the late 90’s it has grown into a globally applied science touching the likes of more than half of fortune 500 companies. "

### Introduction to Themes

Wil van der Aalst pioneered the field of Process Mining in the 1990s. He was the first to investigate the missing link between process and data science. In the first part of this course he will give you an overview of the field and introduce you to important concepts and terminologies.

In this first lecture, Wil will introduce you to the fundamentals of Process Mining and a top-down overview of its structure. You will learn about different tasks in Process Mining and what is needed to accomplish them. Furthermore, after watching this lecture, you will get familiar with the most important attributes of data required for Process Mining: Case, Activity, and Timestamp. By using these types of data, you will not only get valuable insights into the as-is processes, but also will be able to make predictions to optimize processes in the future.

`Hint`: We recommend taking notes and listening actively since there will be quiz questions testing your knowledge!

{% include youtube.html id="N--RTU-IvAQ" %}

By now, you should have learned the definition, history, and importance of Process Mining for different businesses. You should also be familiar with the overview and the different focus areas that the field holds: From Process Discovery to action-oriented Process Mining. Now, let's see how you can apply Process Mining in practice together with Celonis - for this, join the hands-on Lecture by Celonis.

#### Lecture 1: Celonis Hands-On

```
"There are a few important ingredients that provide function and methodology in the world of Process Mining".
```

##### Introduction

Welcome to your first applied lecture within “Process Mining from Theory to Execution”. Wil has already given you an overview of what Process Mining is and how it helps to make vast amounts of process-related data visible and interpretable. 

The purpose of these hands-on exercises and illustrations in Celonis is to show you how academic concepts come into practice in real-life scenarios. There is hardly any other field where academia and industry inspired each other as much as in Process Mining. Techniques for process discovery, conformance checking, and performance analysis emerged from research and were made accessible for a large audience through the Celonis software. In return, large-scale applications of these techniques triggered new research questions. The purpose of this course is to bridge the gap between the two worlds and to show academic concepts in their application in real life. For today we will focus on illustrating some very basic terms and concepts that are important for any Process Mining Analysis. We introduce basic concepts such as event, case, activity, timestamp and event log.

Data can be enormous. Just imagine going back in time the past year to manually collect data about each step you took, when you took it, and where. And what you did next after each step. How would you get it done, and how long would it take you? Luckily, Process Mining can analyze event log data to do just that. There are some fixed terminologies for the analysis of an event log that we want to illustrate today.

##### Demo Data for this Lecture

You might be curious about what you have learned in this practical lecture. The illustrations in this lecture have all been constructed around the Purchase-to-Pay process in a random organisation. Purchase-to-Pay processes are among the most frequently studied processes in organisations since they are error-prone due to huge volumes of transactions, many departments involved and tight deadlines. 

You are encoured to study the demo data yourself in the Celonis Demo below!

## Lecture 2: Process Discovery (1/2) - Learning Directly-Follows Graphs

Welcome to the first part of the Process Discovery chapter and the second Lecture of "Process Mining: From Theory to Execution". In this lecture unit we will take a step further to discover basic process models. We will focus on Directly-Follows Graphs. The aim of this lecture unit is to give you an overview of the basic process models, how to use them and when to apply different filtering techniques to get a clearer view of your model.

Just like all of the other lectures this lecture unit contains a theory lecture from Wil, hands-on illustrations in Celonis as well as a knowledge check quiz! Let's take our second step in the Process Mining Journey now!

### Lecture 2: Process Discovery (1/2) - Learning Directly-Follows Graphs

```
"Directly-Follows Graphs are an extremely scalable way to showing process flows. If you have hundreds of millions of events these can be analyzed without a problem"
```

#### Let's look at Directly-Follows Graphs!

The second lecture is dedicated to a fundamental concept for Process Discovery- Directly-Follows Graphs (DFG). Representing the processes in a very straightforward way, DFGs are a powerful tool to get insights from raw event data. After watching this lecture you will be able to define what a DFG is, understand its basic features, and apply different filtering techniques.

More specifically, you will learn:

how activities and connections complement each other to give you an overview of a process

- what is the difference between a frequency view and a time view
- how DFGs can help you spot bottlenecks in your processes
- how to differentiate between and combine three filtering types to focus on what is important for you.

Hint: We recommend taking notes and listening actively since there will be quiz questions testing your knowledge!

{% include youtube.html id="EyCrJ-Y6BUU" %}

In this lecture you have learnt that DFG is a very powerful tool to show frequencies and spot bottlenecks in processes. In fact DFGs are one of the most frequently used process representations also in industry. They are very intuitive and also allow for a story-telling element as we see the different process variants unfold as the process really happened based on variant frequencies.

Now, it is time to see how DFGs are realized in the Celonis software! Let's move on to the next Practical Lecture by Celonis to explore the power of process models with our example dataset and build your own DFG model!

### Lecture 2: Celonis Hands-On

```
"By looking at all process variants we can see that processes quickly get complex. Filtering methods help to get a better overview of the relevant process variants."
```
