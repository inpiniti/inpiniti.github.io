## 01. Navigate the Celonis Studio : REQUIRED

- Navigate the Celonis Studio

- Course | 30min

- Get familiar with the Celonis Studio: Create Spaces, Packages, &amp; Assets.

Hey there! Welcome to basic navigation in Celonis Studio! 

When you decide to take this course, we assume you do have some coding experience and the term "development environment" does not scare you away. Also, it will aid your understanding if you have a working knowledge of how data gets into Celonis and what a data model is. If you don't, consider taking up the "(opens in a new tab)Get Data into the EMS(opens in a new tab)" training track.

A few technical remarks: If you would like to take a break during the training, remember to close the course using the "Exit Course" button in the top right of the window first before closing your browser window. Otherwise, your progress could get lost. 

The course will take about 32 minutes and the breakdown for each section can be found beside the lesson title.

### 01 01 FIRST STEPS IN STUDIO

#### 01 01 01 Access Studio [3:00]

Welcome to the Celonis Studio!

The Studio allows you to combine functional expertise with the power of Celonis Process Mining to build scalable Apps. Celonis Studio is your one-stop development platform to build, test, and edit Apps in a single, low-code environment. 

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/NdOiqglpvQzR1k4u_NM-N_tWT9-r4KkY4.jpg)

##### Access Your Training Team

Go to your training team and find the Celonis Studio.

Need help accessing your Training Team? Go through our quick guide [here](https://dam.celonis.com/download/en/3fxjBOrZkDrlGbDRxIOrom).

You should see Studio at the navigation bar on the left, towards the bottom. You should also be able to see the Apps at the navigation bar, towards the top. No to-dos yet. Just make sure you're able to access these services, then come back to the course!

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/65a_qCINAYX07bXg_S611kMOEcKVog_bQ.png)

The end-user-facing assets you create and publish from Studio will be accessible by business users in the Apps service, given they have the right permissions. 

#### 01 01 02 Create a Space [3:00]

As you saw in the video, the very first time you open Studio, you'll see a screen similar to the picture on the right. 

If you have previously created assets in your Training Team's Studio, then you'll already see a Space and one or more packages in the package explorer.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/0mQ9xKsY2OmNrZJL_hH4pAPvpAU-MZabO.jpg)

What's a Space?

We assume that you already have a little coding experience so you will know that in every development environment you actually start by creating something often called a project or a workspace. The workspace or Space is a structural element that allows you to organize your work in a meaningful way — and to still find what you've been working on a week later…

Similarly, our UX designers did a great job in guiding you towards your very first step in Studio: Creating a Space. 

![](.\rsc\20230407142428.png)

![](.\rsc\20230407142525.png)

![](.\rsc\20230407142546.png)

If you already have a Space in Studio and want to create a new or additional one, then follow the steps shown in the video below.

![](.\rsc\20230407142848.png)

![](.\rsc\20230407142930.png)

![](.\rsc\20230407142949.png)

Great! First step done! We're getting closer to the heart of where we will build our Apps!

Note that you can always see the current space you're working in in the upper left corner. You can also switch to other spaces using the dropdown carrot.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/A3wofX1mxkYSCCSr_c9Nw4hJrgmNuCtXs.png)

##### Your turn!

Go back to Studio and create a space called "Training" just as you've just seen it in the video. Make sure to spell it correctly. If you're unsure what to do, here are two suggestions: 

- Rewatch the video

- Check out the documentation

But we're sure you'll manage :) Come back to the course once you've successfully created the space. 

#### 01 01 03 Create a Package [4:00]

Once you've successfully created a Space, Studio suggests two options as the next step: either create a package or install an app from the Marketplace, which is naturally organized in a package(s). 

In the Marketplace, you can find apps built by Celonis and the Celonis Ecosystem. But let's get back to what we're actually aiming for: Learning about the toolkit to build an app.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/5_jfBvAf4Z44wR7g_pvqZx71BLDetUcnm.png)

##### What's a Package?

After we've created a Space, we need a Package as another structural element. It is similar to folders and various subfolders on your hard drive and allows you to organize your work in a meaningful way. You can create as many Packages as you see fit. You'll develop a feel for that over time. 

##### Create a Package

There are actually two ways to do so: either click the button on the left or the big button in the middle.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/iS_nw2G6t0jUkV28_RaHikdzv1KTaYvzi.png)

Watch the video below to see how to create a package called "My first package."

![](.\rsc\20230407143210.png)

![](.\rsc\20230407143230.png)

![](.\rsc\20230407143246.png)

Did you note how the package's "key" automatically got populated? If not, play the video again. 

The key allows you to uniquely identify the package throughout your Celonis team while you can have multiple packages with the same name. 

It's a good practice to never change any key. In the case of packages, it's not even possible to do so once you've created the package. Also, in general, changing the name of an asset that you create in Studio doesn't have an effect on the key. 

##### Your turn!

Go back to Studio and create a package called "My first package," just as you've just seen it in the video. Make sure to spell it correctly. If you're unsure what to do, again, you have two options: 

- Rewatch the video

- Check out the ![documentation](https://docs.celonis.com/en/studio.html)

You can do it!

###### We've completed the second step of our Celonis Studio tour and created a package!

From here, you have various options on how to move on while the first two steps - space and package - are always the same. 

The options you see at the moment are what we call assets except for the last one, which is a folder for organizing the assets. More on assets in the next section... 

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/lxtwkNTZyM10g9Te_37lcBZXNNRpAY_s1.jpg)

### 01 02 ASSETS IN STUDIO

#### 01 02 01 Put Assets into Context [6:00]

Once you've created a Space and a Package in Studio, your set-up is ready to house a variety of assets. Which assets you choose and how you'll combine them will determine what your final App looks like and the functionalities it provides. Here are the assets you can choose from:

- View
- Analysis
- Skill
- Knowledge Model
- Simulation
- Data Explorer
- Action Flow

For starters, let's become familiar with Action Flow, Analysis, and Process Simulation as assets, then dive into Knowledge Model and View since things can get a bit nuanced.

- ACTION FLOW

Using Action Flows you can integrate various systems with each other seamlessly. You can, for example, trigger a chain of actions in various ERP systems by the user's click of a single button in a View.

Of course, there are numerous use cases to utilize Action Flows as a standalone asset without integrating them into an Execution App. Action Flows can be triggered from various applications and through Webhooks. Or they can be scheduled to run automatically according to specific time intervals.

If you're intrigued, take note to check out the training track, [Build Action Flows](https://academy.celonis.com/learn/learning-path/build-action-flows).

Here's an example of an Action Flow:

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/Si0oCa5HJ49e-DaH_FubRcdtel9SoIy1D.jpg)

- ANALYSIS

An Analysis is typically used by process experts and improvement specialists to drill deeper into a particular matter of interest. The nature of the Analysis depends on what your process experts and improvement specialists need and what you've worked out in the [ideation and design phases](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-ideation-in-design-thinking/) before you've started to learn the mechanics of Studio.

In the Analysis for Sustainable Procurement example below, you can gain deep insights into supplier ratings based on sustainability criteria. If you'd like to learn more about this analysis, [listen to Michael](https://youtu.be/Xj7laJruLvM). 

If you're interested in learning how to build an Analysis for any use case, you might want to start with the training track, [Build Analyses – Basics](https://academy.celonis.com/learn/learning-path/build-analyses-basics). 

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/eIamLasFqJKAbp4M_LsWDWooJ7SWhzZ--.png)

- SIMULATION

Modern organizations are looking for a data-driven way to know beforehand how big or small changes in their processes could impact the process outcome.

Simulation (formerly known as Process Simulation) allows your organization to simulate the full impact of changes in your processes and lets you evaluate all your optimization scenarios.

If you believe this could empower your end-users, take note of the course, [Celonis Process Simulation](https://academy.celonis.com/learn/course/celonis-process-simulation).

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/3O7zStOnFGlk46eF_b7eMnMq8Wfn5D-hz.jpg)

As you might have concluded by now, an Execution App is a concept rather than an asset in Celonis. You combine multiple assets, depending on the need, to create an Execution App, where the end goal is to maximize the execution capacity of the organization.

- VIEW (EXAMPLE 1)

What we're looking at below is an Accounts Payable Execution App, more specifically a View, designed for a manager to monitor KPIs and dynamically set the strategy for the team from within the View.

Take a special note that we look at this app from a developer or app builder perspective and not from an end-user perspective. Accordingly, we are in Studio and not in Apps where end-users go to use the app.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/IpvL1H6gJNsG1SHM_w9TbEkxZx9qrUZKn.png)

- VIEW (EXAMPLE 2)

This is another View, designed for an operational person in Accounts Payable.

In this View, the business users' suggested tasks are prioritized based on the KPI that is given priority in the manager's View. By clicking each invoice, in this example, the operational clerk can review a list of suggested tasks to address any execution gaps.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/2LKqE3CFlXNSVyZM_ZZUmhio6sQFQ36bY.jpg)

-KNOWLEDGE MODEL

A View will always require another asset, a Knowledge Model, in order to function. The Knowledge Model is a little like the View's brain. Can you build a View without a Knowledge Model? Yes, but it doesn't make a lot of sense.  

And here's why. The Knowledge Model "tells" the View what KPI value to display and where to find information such as Vendor names or company codes in the data model. It contains calculation schemes and PQL functions which are processed in real-time once an action is performed inside a View. Knowledge Models not only define KPIs but also Variables, Filters, and Records amongst other so-called Knowledge Objects. 

Both of the Views you reviewed in the previous two tabs were created using this Knowledge Model.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/QNNB_JmvITSDLsW__P_xZ2X2rWQyaXl2O.jpg)

Note that there are no hard definitions in terms of how many or which assets an Execution App consists of. It's up to you and depends on your individual use case. What will help you though is going through the exercise of defining a proper persona as well as a user journey for the Execution App you want to build . . .

Check out our page on [Execution Apps](https://www.celonis.com/ems/apps/overview/) if you would like to become familiar with the purpose-built apps already available through Celonis.

That was a lot to take in. . . Let's summarize what we've covered so far: 

- To start in Studio, we need two structural elements: a Space and a Package.
- We can add various assets to a package such as a View, an Analysis, a Knowledge Model, an Action Flow, or a Process Simulation.
- A View always comes in combination with a Knowledge Model.
- A Knowledge Model is created off of a Data Model that the Data Engineer typically has prepared.
- An Analysis can also be combined with a Knowledge Model but doesn't have to; it can be built directly from a Data Model.
- An Action Flow can be a standalone asset or can be combined with an Analysis or View to form an Execution App. 
- Finally, remember that Knowledge Models are hidden from the end-user view, as are Action Flows.

Before we move on, how about we test your understanding? Which assets are only accessible to app builders? Drag and drop them to the "App builders" category. Drag and drop all others to the "Both" (app builders and end-users) category.

[문제 link](https://academy.celonis.com/learn/course/navigate-the-celonis-studio/navigate-the-celonis-studio/course-outline?client=public-panorama&page=2)

Are you excited to add an asset to your package by now? Let's move on to the next lesson to do so.

#### 01 02 02 Add an Asset to the Package [5:00]

We're back in our training team where we left off before. The only difference is that we now have a better idea of the different assets represent. 

To create an asset, you either click the big tile in the middle or, hover over the package, click the plus (+) symbol, and then choose the type of asset.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/ua2PP78i0LVnZeBu_a6NVDx87XXzIZT77.jpg)

##### Add a Knowledge Model

Let's choose the Knowledge Model as our first asset to add to our package. Remember that we need a Knowledge Model in order to create a View. Upon selecting Knowledge Model we're prompted to choose from two options: Base and Extension. But what's the difference between these two?

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/Co_XrQmNaE8I5Ouu_HTxADGcK47PZ9inC.png)

Creating a Base Knowledge Model means you create one from scratch while an Extension Knowledge Model extends an already existing one. 

In the video below, you'll see that we choose the Base-type Knowledge Model. We specify the Knowledge Model Name and then choose a Data Model Variable. The Data Model variable is the link between the Knowledge Model and Data Model. The exact purpose of the data model VARIABLE will become clearer soon.

![](.\rsc\20230407144243.png)

![](.\rsc\20230407144301.png)

![](.\rsc\20230407144320.png)

![](.\rsc\20230407144343.png)

![](.\rsc\20230407144401.png)

![](.\rsc\20230407144416.png)

![](.\rsc\20230407144448.png)

And there it is! Our first very small Knowledge Model!

Here's the question we've not asked yet: Where does the data come from that is described in Knowledge Models and displayed in Views? As described previously, it comes from a Data Model that the Data Engineer creates. So, naturally, you want to make sure this has already been done by the Data Engineer by the time you sit down to create a Knowledge Model.

##### Your turn!

Access your package and create your first asset. You can choose any asset but we advise you to stick to the Knowledge Model. Of course, you can create multiple assets too if you feel like it. 

Which resources do you have available in case you get stuck?

→ The video

→ The Documentation

Let's pause to make sure you have the correct understanding of some of the concepts we covered.

True or False? You can build a Knowledge Model without a Data Model. 

- [ ] True

- [x] False

> Once the Data Engineer has prepared the Data Model, you can proceed to build a Knowledge Model off of it.

True or False? You can build a View directly off of a Data Model.

- [ ] True

- [x] False

> First, you need to build a Knowledge Model and connect it to a Data Model. An Analysis, however, can be built directly off of a Data Model.

By now you have a good understanding of creating assets, and you know that the first two steps toward this task involve a Space and a Package.

#### 01 03 ADMINISTERING AND MANAGING STUDIO
#### 01 03 01 Assign Permissions [4:00]

You can assign and adjust permissions in Studio at different levels; in other words, you can define who should be able to view and/or edit all assets in a Space or Package, or a specific Asset(s) in a Package.  

##### Space: Permissions

Let's look at Spaces first. To review and assign Space permissions, just click the three dots and select the appropriate option. The options are quite self-explanatory and ticking the box lets the permission take effect. If you'd like to review details on the different permission options, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.celonis.com/en/studio.html#UUID-54a37cea-24d8-8459-8668-a517455a4e19_id_Studio-Permissions).

![](.\rsc\20230407144859.png)

![](.\rsc\20230407144913.png)

If you have multiple spaces, you might want to apply different sets of permissions. Just click the dropdown arrow next to the Space name to switch to other Spaces first.

##### Package: Permissions

You can also set permissions at Package-level rather than Space-level. 

Go to your training team, find the package permissions available and tick all options below that you find:

- [ ] Use All Packages

- [ ] Edit Package

- [ ] Manage Permissions

- [ ] Edit Space

Pop quiz!

If you want to give a business user Package permission to only use the Package (along with all its Assets) in Apps, what type of permission(s) should you enable?

- [x] Use Package

- [ ] Edit Package

- [ ] Delete Package

- [ ] Manage Permissions

> Not quite. If you hover at the icons beside the "Use Package" and "Edit Package" column headers, you should see the type of role the permissions encompass. Analysts generally require permissions to make changes to the Packages (and Assets), as opposed to Viewers (which include business users), who would only need to be able to interact with the Assets in Apps.
