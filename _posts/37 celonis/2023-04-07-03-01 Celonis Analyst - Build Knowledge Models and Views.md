## 01. Navigate the Celonis Studio : REQUIRED

- Navigate the Celonis Studio

- Course | 30min

- Get familiar with the Celonis Studio: Create Spaces, Packages, &amp; Assets.

Hey there! Welcome to basic navigation in Celonis Studio! 

When you decide to take this course, we assume you do have some coding experience and the term "development environment" does not scare you away. Also, it will aid your understanding if you have a working knowledge of how data gets into Celonis and what a data model is. If you don't, consider taking up the "(opens in a new tab)Get Data into the EMS(opens in a new tab)" training track.

A few technical remarks: If you would like to take a break during the training, remember to close the course using the "Exit Course" button in the top right of the window first before closing your browser window. Otherwise, your progress could get lost. 

The course will take about 32 minutes and the breakdown for each section can be found beside the lesson title.

### 01 01 FIRST STEPS IN STUDIO

#### 01 01 01 Access Studio [3:00]

Welcome to the Celonis Studio!

The Studio allows you to combine functional expertise with the power of Celonis Process Mining to build scalable Apps. Celonis Studio is your one-stop development platform to build, test, and edit Apps in a single, low-code environment. 

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/NdOiqglpvQzR1k4u_NM-N_tWT9-r4KkY4.jpg)

##### Access Your Training Team

Go to your training team and find the Celonis Studio.

Need help accessing your Training Team? Go through our quick guide [here](https://dam.celonis.com/download/en/3fxjBOrZkDrlGbDRxIOrom).

You should see Studio at the navigation bar on the left, towards the bottom. You should also be able to see the Apps at the navigation bar, towards the top. No to-dos yet. Just make sure you're able to access these services, then come back to the course!

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/65a_qCINAYX07bXg_S611kMOEcKVog_bQ.png)

The end-user-facing assets you create and publish from Studio will be accessible by business users in the Apps service, given they have the right permissions. 

#### 01 01 02 Create a Space [3:00]

As you saw in the video, the very first time you open Studio, you'll see a screen similar to the picture on the right. 

If you have previously created assets in your Training Team's Studio, then you'll already see a Space and one or more packages in the package explorer.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/0mQ9xKsY2OmNrZJL_hH4pAPvpAU-MZabO.jpg)

What's a Space?

We assume that you already have a little coding experience so you will know that in every development environment you actually start by creating something often called a project or a workspace. The workspace or Space is a structural element that allows you to organize your work in a meaningful way — and to still find what you've been working on a week later…

Similarly, our UX designers did a great job in guiding you towards your very first step in Studio: Creating a Space. 

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407142428.png)

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407142508.png)

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407142525.png)

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407142546.png)

If you already have a Space in Studio and want to create a new or additional one, then follow the steps shown in the video below.

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407142848.png)

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407142930.png)

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407142949.png)

Great! First step done! We're getting closer to the heart of where we will build our Apps!

Note that you can always see the current space you're working in in the upper left corner. You can also switch to other spaces using the dropdown carrot.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/A3wofX1mxkYSCCSr_c9Nw4hJrgmNuCtXs.png)

##### Your turn!

Go back to Studio and create a space called "Training" just as you've just seen it in the video. Make sure to spell it correctly. If you're unsure what to do, here are two suggestions: 

- Rewatch the video

- Check out the documentation

But we're sure you'll manage :) Come back to the course once you've successfully created the space. 

#### 01 01 03 Create a Package [4:00]

Once you've successfully created a Space, Studio suggests two options as the next step: either create a package or install an app from the Marketplace, which is naturally organized in a package(s). 

In the Marketplace, you can find apps built by Celonis and the Celonis Ecosystem. But let's get back to what we're actually aiming for: Learning about the toolkit to build an app.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/5_jfBvAf4Z44wR7g_pvqZx71BLDetUcnm.png)

##### What's a Package?

After we've created a Space, we need a Package as another structural element. It is similar to folders and various subfolders on your hard drive and allows you to organize your work in a meaningful way. You can create as many Packages as you see fit. You'll develop a feel for that over time. 

##### Create a Package

There are actually two ways to do so: either click the button on the left or the big button in the middle.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/iS_nw2G6t0jUkV28_RaHikdzv1KTaYvzi.png)

Watch the video below to see how to create a package called "My first package."

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407143210.png)

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407143230.png)

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407143246.png)

Did you note how the package's "key" automatically got populated? If not, play the video again. 

The key allows you to uniquely identify the package throughout your Celonis team while you can have multiple packages with the same name. 

It's a good practice to never change any key. In the case of packages, it's not even possible to do so once you've created the package. Also, in general, changing the name of an asset that you create in Studio doesn't have an effect on the key. 

##### Your turn!

Go back to Studio and create a package called "My first package," just as you've just seen it in the video. Make sure to spell it correctly. If you're unsure what to do, again, you have two options: 

- Rewatch the video

- Check out the ![documentation](https://docs.celonis.com/en/studio.html)

You can do it!

###### We've completed the second step of our Celonis Studio tour and created a package!

From here, you have various options on how to move on while the first two steps - space and package - are always the same. 

The options you see at the moment are what we call assets except for the last one, which is a folder for organizing the assets. More on assets in the next section... 

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/lxtwkNTZyM10g9Te_37lcBZXNNRpAY_s1.jpg)

### 01 02 ASSETS IN STUDIO

#### 01 02 01 Put Assets into Context [6:00]

Once you've created a Space and a Package in Studio, your set-up is ready to house a variety of assets. Which assets you choose and how you'll combine them will determine what your final App looks like and the functionalities it provides. Here are the assets you can choose from:

- View
- Analysis
- Skill
- Knowledge Model
- Simulation
- Data Explorer
- Action Flow

For starters, let's become familiar with Action Flow, Analysis, and Process Simulation as assets, then dive into Knowledge Model and View since things can get a bit nuanced.

- ACTION FLOW

Using Action Flows you can integrate various systems with each other seamlessly. You can, for example, trigger a chain of actions in various ERP systems by the user's click of a single button in a View.

Of course, there are numerous use cases to utilize Action Flows as a standalone asset without integrating them into an Execution App. Action Flows can be triggered from various applications and through Webhooks. Or they can be scheduled to run automatically according to specific time intervals.

If you're intrigued, take note to check out the training track, [Build Action Flows](https://academy.celonis.com/learn/learning-path/build-action-flows).

Here's an example of an Action Flow:

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/Si0oCa5HJ49e-DaH_FubRcdtel9SoIy1D.jpg)

- ANALYSIS

An Analysis is typically used by process experts and improvement specialists to drill deeper into a particular matter of interest. The nature of the Analysis depends on what your process experts and improvement specialists need and what you've worked out in the [ideation and design phases](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-ideation-in-design-thinking/) before you've started to learn the mechanics of Studio.

In the Analysis for Sustainable Procurement example below, you can gain deep insights into supplier ratings based on sustainability criteria. If you'd like to learn more about this analysis, [listen to Michael](https://youtu.be/Xj7laJruLvM). 

If you're interested in learning how to build an Analysis for any use case, you might want to start with the training track, [Build Analyses – Basics](https://academy.celonis.com/learn/learning-path/build-analyses-basics). 

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/eIamLasFqJKAbp4M_LsWDWooJ7SWhzZ--.png)

- SIMULATION

Modern organizations are looking for a data-driven way to know beforehand how big or small changes in their processes could impact the process outcome.

Simulation (formerly known as Process Simulation) allows your organization to simulate the full impact of changes in your processes and lets you evaluate all your optimization scenarios.

If you believe this could empower your end-users, take note of the course, [Celonis Process Simulation](https://academy.celonis.com/learn/course/celonis-process-simulation).

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/3O7zStOnFGlk46eF_b7eMnMq8Wfn5D-hz.jpg)

As you might have concluded by now, an Execution App is a concept rather than an asset in Celonis. You combine multiple assets, depending on the need, to create an Execution App, where the end goal is to maximize the execution capacity of the organization.

- VIEW (EXAMPLE 1)

What we're looking at below is an Accounts Payable Execution App, more specifically a View, designed for a manager to monitor KPIs and dynamically set the strategy for the team from within the View.

Take a special note that we look at this app from a developer or app builder perspective and not from an end-user perspective. Accordingly, we are in Studio and not in Apps where end-users go to use the app.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/IpvL1H6gJNsG1SHM_w9TbEkxZx9qrUZKn.png)

- VIEW (EXAMPLE 2)

This is another View, designed for an operational person in Accounts Payable.

In this View, the business users' suggested tasks are prioritized based on the KPI that is given priority in the manager's View. By clicking each invoice, in this example, the operational clerk can review a list of suggested tasks to address any execution gaps.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/2LKqE3CFlXNSVyZM_ZZUmhio6sQFQ36bY.jpg)

-KNOWLEDGE MODEL

A View will always require another asset, a Knowledge Model, in order to function. The Knowledge Model is a little like the View's brain. Can you build a View without a Knowledge Model? Yes, but it doesn't make a lot of sense.  

And here's why. The Knowledge Model "tells" the View what KPI value to display and where to find information such as Vendor names or company codes in the data model. It contains calculation schemes and PQL functions which are processed in real-time once an action is performed inside a View. Knowledge Models not only define KPIs but also Variables, Filters, and Records amongst other so-called Knowledge Objects. 

Both of the Views you reviewed in the previous two tabs were created using this Knowledge Model.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/QNNB_JmvITSDLsW__P_xZ2X2rWQyaXl2O.jpg)

Note that there are no hard definitions in terms of how many or which assets an Execution App consists of. It's up to you and depends on your individual use case. What will help you though is going through the exercise of defining a proper persona as well as a user journey for the Execution App you want to build . . .

Check out our page on [Execution Apps](https://www.celonis.com/ems/apps/overview/) if you would like to become familiar with the purpose-built apps already available through Celonis.

That was a lot to take in. . . Let's summarize what we've covered so far: 

- To start in Studio, we need two structural elements: a Space and a Package.
- We can add various assets to a package such as a View, an Analysis, a Knowledge Model, an Action Flow, or a Process Simulation.
- A View always comes in combination with a Knowledge Model.
- A Knowledge Model is created off of a Data Model that the Data Engineer typically has prepared.
- An Analysis can also be combined with a Knowledge Model but doesn't have to; it can be built directly from a Data Model.
- An Action Flow can be a standalone asset or can be combined with an Analysis or View to form an Execution App. 
- Finally, remember that Knowledge Models are hidden from the end-user view, as are Action Flows.

Before we move on, how about we test your understanding? Which assets are only accessible to app builders? Drag and drop them to the "App builders" category. Drag and drop all others to the "Both" (app builders and end-users) category.

[문제 link](https://academy.celonis.com/learn/course/navigate-the-celonis-studio/navigate-the-celonis-studio/course-outline?client=public-panorama&page=2)

Are you excited to add an asset to your package by now? Let's move on to the next lesson to do so.

#### 01 02 02 Add an Asset to the Package [5:00]

We're back in our training team where we left off before. The only difference is that we now have a better idea of the different assets represent. 

To create an asset, you either click the big tile in the middle or, hover over the package, click the plus (+) symbol, and then choose the type of asset.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/ua2PP78i0LVnZeBu_a6NVDx87XXzIZT77.jpg)

##### Add a Knowledge Model

Let's choose the Knowledge Model as our first asset to add to our package. Remember that we need a Knowledge Model in order to create a View. Upon selecting Knowledge Model we're prompted to choose from two options: Base and Extension. But what's the difference between these two?

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/Co_XrQmNaE8I5Ouu_HTxADGcK47PZ9inC.png)

Creating a Base Knowledge Model means you create one from scratch while an Extension Knowledge Model extends an already existing one. 

In the video below, you'll see that we choose the Base-type Knowledge Model. We specify the Knowledge Model Name and then choose a Data Model Variable. The Data Model variable is the link between the Knowledge Model and Data Model. The exact purpose of the data model VARIABLE will become clearer soon.

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407144243.png)

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407144301.png)

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407144320.png)

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407144343.png)

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407144401.png)

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407144416.png)

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407144448.png)

And there it is! Our first very small Knowledge Model!

Here's the question we've not asked yet: Where does the data come from that is described in Knowledge Models and displayed in Views? As described previously, it comes from a Data Model that the Data Engineer creates. So, naturally, you want to make sure this has already been done by the Data Engineer by the time you sit down to create a Knowledge Model.

##### Your turn!

Access your package and create your first asset. You can choose any asset but we advise you to stick to the Knowledge Model. Of course, you can create multiple assets too if you feel like it. 

Which resources do you have available in case you get stuck?

→ The video

→ The Documentation

Let's pause to make sure you have the correct understanding of some of the concepts we covered.

True or False? You can build a Knowledge Model without a Data Model. 

- [ ] True

- [x] False

> Once the Data Engineer has prepared the Data Model, you can proceed to build a Knowledge Model off of it.

True or False? You can build a View directly off of a Data Model.

- [ ] True

- [x] False

> First, you need to build a Knowledge Model and connect it to a Data Model. An Analysis, however, can be built directly off of a Data Model.

By now you have a good understanding of creating assets, and you know that the first two steps toward this task involve a Space and a Package.

#### 01 03 ADMINISTERING AND MANAGING STUDIO
#### 01 03 01 Assign Permissions [4:00]

You can assign and adjust permissions in Studio at different levels; in other words, you can define who should be able to view and/or edit all assets in a Space or Package, or a specific Asset(s) in a Package.  

##### Space: Permissions

Let's look at Spaces first. To review and assign Space permissions, just click the three dots and select the appropriate option. The options are quite self-explanatory and ticking the box lets the permission take effect. If you'd like to review details on the different permission options, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.celonis.com/en/studio.html#UUID-54a37cea-24d8-8459-8668-a517455a4e19_id_Studio-Permissions).

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407144859.png)

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407144913.png)

If you have multiple spaces, you might want to apply different sets of permissions. Just click the dropdown arrow next to the Space name to switch to other Spaces first.

##### Package: Permissions

You can also set permissions at Package-level rather than Space-level. 

Go to your training team, find the package permissions available and tick all options below that you find:

- [ ] Use All Packages

- [ ] Edit Package

- [ ] Manage Permissions

- [ ] Edit Space

Pop quiz!

If you want to give a business user Package permission to only use the Package (along with all its Assets) in Apps, what type of permission(s) should you enable?

- [x] Use Package

- [ ] Edit Package

- [ ] Delete Package

- [ ] Manage Permissions

> Not quite. If you hover at the icons beside the "Use Package" and "Edit Package" column headers, you should see the type of role the permissions encompass. Analysts generally require permissions to make changes to the Packages (and Assets), as opposed to Viewers (which include business users), who would only need to be able to interact with the Assets in Apps.

##### Asset Permissions

You can also assign permissions at Asset-level. But why would you? Let's say you have organized your assets into Packages by processes. You have an Accounts Payable Package, and within it, you have a Knowledge Model, an Analysis for executives, an Analysis for improvement specialists, and a View for clerks. If you want to give a user access to just one of the Assets (one of the two Analyses or the View), then you'll want to do so at Asset-level.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/1t5tbS9A0Vh2Z9n2_U7rzPArTU1vjchJq.png)

What if you want to give a user permission for all the Assets in the Package? How would you do it? 

In this case, giving the user the permission at Package-level is more efficient. You see there are quite some options available. As always, it depends on your use case and your end-users' needs which combination to choose. 

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/yDNQPn5Je7ZkCKZy_mLworXo-8ulehw59.png)

##### Template

Did you notice that as you assign permissions, you also have the option of using the predefined templates?

User permissions are generally for business users or users who only need to access Celonis Apps.

Editor permissions are generally for Analysts or App Developers who need to access the Space/Package/Asset in Studio to make changes.

Have a look at the permission settings of your Package. What type of permission do you have?

#### 01 03 02 Review Package Settings [4:00]

Remember how we briefly talked about Data Model Variables when we created a Knowledge Model? You might have wondered why the term "variable." 

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/RibH9l0dFMcR6duH_w-Kh_iXMRFktEjDj.png)

When we created a Knowledge Model, we did so by linking it to a single Data Model. This is important to remember. We can associate only one Data Model with each Knowledge Model. In addition, a View can be linked to a Knowledge Model. 

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/dh5jdGtkaGGUsK-v_us2y2jOYMMqTjG00.png)

What about a Package? How many Knowledge Models and Data Models can it be associated with? Since a package can hold multiple assets, and therefore multiple Knowledge Models, we can conclude that a Package can reference multiple Data Models.

Now hopefully the word "variable" in the term "Data Model Variable" starts to make more sense. Imagine we have one Package which holds multiple Knowledge Models (which are referenced by different Views). There might be multiple Knowledge Models that reference the same Data Model. What if you had to change that Data Model? Would you have to go into each single Knowledge Model and adjust it? No, luckily not! That's exactly what the Data Model Variables are for; you only change it at one place and it automatically applies to every asset that is referencing this data model variable. Cool, right?

##### Data Model Variables

Let's take a look at where we can see all the Data Model Variables associated with a Package.

Data Model Variables
Let's take a look at where we can see all the Data Model Variables associated with a Package.

`Step 1`

##### Package Settings

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407145559.png)

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407145612.png)

All Data Model variables of a package are listed in the package settings. You can access those by clicking the three dots and then selecting "Settings". 

`Step 2`

##### General tab

There are a few tabs in the Package settings, such as General, Variables, and Dependencies.

What you can see in the General tab is what you already saw before: The Package name and its key. Here’s where you would change the Package name, but keep in mind, the key will remain the same as the one when you created the package in the first place. Below the name and key, you see Published Versions. We'll touch soon on what is meant by the Published Versions. 

`Step 3`

##### Variables tab

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/tLbBITvRQQ075Lrp_W9ON0AZ8uTuSuX9U.jpg)

In the Variables tab, you see the Data Model Variable we created while setting up the Knowledge Model. You can create as many Data Model Variables here as you like. Especially when you download an Execution App from the EMS store, your first step will most likely be to assign a Data Model Variable.

##### Now you check it out!
Go to the Package Settings and take a look at the tabs.

##### Question for you...
      
If you're not already in Package Settings, do access it to answer the question below.

What is the definition of a Package dependency? 

- [ ] Dependencies show data models and variables that the Package is associated with.

- [ ] Dependencies are other Packages that are required for this Package to operate. 

- [ ] By adding a Package as a dependency, its Views and Knowledge Models can be reused using this extension mechanism.

> Check out the Dependencies tab in Package Settings to see for yourself.

#### 01 03 03 Publish a Package and Work with Versions [3:00]

Did you note the little number in the "Publish Package" button on the top right when you added your first asset?

Any changes you make within Studio will be automatically saved as a draft. Changes include:

- Adding an Asset

- Deleting an Asset

- Modifying an Asset

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/vXbgw_Pj2Wrtu6Ep_yQDKWIkh0lbPfWO5.png)

However, business users will not see these changes (in Apps) until you publish them to the team. Some modifications in Studio might only be possible or have an effect after you've published the package. 

##### Your turn!

Go to your training team and give it a try: Publish your package by clicking the respective button. 

Since this is very likely the first time you publish the package, you can keep the suggested version number (1.0.0).

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/qTDJABllbTXSNxJ__0fJjDy5umpNI2UaN.jpg)

##### Best Practice for Versioning

Did you wonder how to specify the version number? As the pop-up window indicated, it should be assigned in the format of "Major.Minor.Patch." Click through the categories below to find out about best practices.

##### Major

> A complete update or shift in the current asset. Changes would greatly affect Business Users if no communication were properly given in advance.

##### Minor

> Tweaks in the apps that won’t necessarily require communication or messaging to Business Users. Examples include tweaking a KPI, making color changes, or changing chart types in a View asset.

##### Patch

> Very small changes that may go unnoticed to a Business User. Examples include an update to the calculation of a KPI, or changes in titles.

The Studio saves all published versions so you can always switch back to a previously published version. You can see this in the Package's Settings, the General tab. 

You probably know the concept from Dropbox, Google Drive, or similar applications. It's super handy and there will be situations in which you will be very glad that this functionality exists ;-)

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/69933a3c-a5f0-47d7-992c-71b649590282/9/scormcontent/assets/f8SsL27FEj4ude8P__hGIrqhed_t27uOK.png)

## 02. YAML Basics : ELECTIVE

- YAML Basics

- Learn the basics of the data serialization language YAML.

Hey there! Welcome to YAML Basics! If you plan to build Knowledge Models and Views, and you don't know anything about YAML yet, then this module is for you. You'll be in a good position to take this training if you can roughly explain what JSON, XML, or HTTP is. 

One technical remark: If you would like to take a break during the training, remember to close the course using the "Exit Course" button in the top right of the window first before closing your browser window. Otherwise, your progress could get lost. 

The course will require about 18 minutes of your time and the breakdown for each section can be found beside the lesson title.

### 02 01 When to use YAML [3:00]

The course description already said it: If you want to build a Knowledge Model or a View, what you'll need to be able to read, understand, adjust, and write is YAML - a generic data serialization language.

With YAML, you can define how your View should look and how the Knowledge Model is constructed.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/a3a92418-5ce5-4004-863d-4699415856f8/3/scormcontent/assets/Y8Laa2PvGMCXdBtB_L77fCnAb3aupP3C-.png)

Although both assets can also be built using the Visual Editor, bear in mind that there's still a lot of development going on. This means that not all components are ready to be built solely by using the Visual Editor.

Maybe you're not that much of a Visual Editor person. Maybe you would even prefer to write YAML scripts instead - which a lot of people still do.

##### Can you utilize the YAML Editor in Studio?

If you have already created a Knowledge Model or a View in the Celonis Studio, go ahead and open the YAML Editor. The YAML editor is where you'll script your YAML configurations.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/a3a92418-5ce5-4004-863d-4699415856f8/3/scormcontent/assets/X5PUtsZeYAh3wFof_n7WAykK5FBt95mJp.gif)

### 02 02 The general structure of YAML [05:00]

Here are some additional resources you can leverage to learn about YAML: 

- [The Official YAML Website](https://yaml.org/)

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)

- [YouTube](https://youtu.be/cdLNKUoMc6c)

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=yaml&s=3b1278f8-3e4a-45e6-b724-4cad4025a70d)

### 02 03 Test your YAML knowledge [10:00]

Did you take some time to understand and recap what's been going on in the video in the last lesson? Remember that the video's intention is for you to press pause and repeat it as often as you need it!

Check out the code snippet below which is a piece of a View and then answer some questions about it.

```
metadata:
  key: steering-view
  template: false
  name: Steering View
  knowledgeModelKey: knowledge-model-views-training
  profileView: false
variables:
  - name: currentKpi
    defaultValue: DPO_KPI
    type: STRING
  - name: currentKpiName
    defaultValue: Process Cycle Time Days
    type: STRING
```

How many different objects can you identify? 

- [x] 2

- [ ] 4

> The metadata, the variables and each item in the list counts as one object. 

The YAML Editor in Studio does a pretty good job to validate everything you type on the go...

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/a3a92418-5ce5-4004-863d-4699415856f8/3/scormcontent/assets/qMK5vABPoSxN-OSW_7oCQxgKJHOdcPNLa.jpg)

Check out the error above - can you name what is causing the error? How would you try to resolve it?

- [ ] The indentation of the key 'defaultValue' is wrong. Deleting the space in front will resolve the error. 

- [ ] The value of the parameter 'name' is wrong. It should be changed to 'Process Cycle Time Days'.

Well done! You've already reached the end of this course. Don't be scared when you see a fully mature Knowledge Model or View YAML configuration for the first time. It will look a little complex but if you understood the concept covered in this module you will find it easy to figure everything out.

Thanks for taking this course! We hope you enjoyed it.

## 03.The Interdependence of Knowledge Models and Views : REQUIRED

- The Interdependence of Knowledge Models and Views

- Understand how Knowledge Models &amp; Views co-exist with each other.

Welcome!

Hey there! Welcome to this module! Make sure you've taken the course ["Navigate the Celonis Studio"](https://academy.celonis.com/learn/course/navigate-the-celonis-studio) or at least have a good idea of what an "Asset" is in Celonis Studio before starting this one. 

We'll require about 12 minutes of your time for this module. 

One technical remark: If you want to take a break, remember to close the course using the "Exit Course" button in the top right of the window first before closing your browser window. Otherwise, your progress could be lost.

### 03 01 ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KNOWLEDGE MODELS AND VIEWS
#### 03 01 01 Knowledge Model? View? [2:00]

"A Knowledge Model is like the brain of a View"

-Someone at Celonis, probably

If this quote makes 99.9% sense to you by the end of this module, then we did our job right!

##### But let's start from the top.
What does a View look like? And what about a Knowledge Model? Browse through the following examples to get a better idea.

`Example 1`

##### Hey there! I'm a View!

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/3a10defb-2d93-4825-b5f6-d3b4cf5f6149/3/scormcontent/assets/Xkdvx8FX-yoOfQoo_jmT0nqOhgMJ2p3jo.png)

My name in this example is "Steering View".

`Example 2`

##### Hi :) I'm a View, too!

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/3a10defb-2d93-4825-b5f6-d3b4cf5f6149/3/scormcontent/assets/ygvYlCjYufndbpBW_ocpqs08sffpT1Hy-.jpg)

My purpose is different from the Steering View. So I look different and also have another name, "Action View". Technically speaking I'm still a View though. 

`Example 3`

##### Greetings! I'm a Knowledge Model.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/3a10defb-2d93-4825-b5f6-d3b4cf5f6149/3/scormcontent/assets/NIuC_WCYx0IYsFUj_TD7ONjBwr-l2mjoC.png)

Both the Views you've seen before would literally be nothing without me. Without me, they wouldn't know which numbers to display or where to get the information about open invoices from. 

##### No View without a Knowledge Model and vice versa.
  Using the View asset, you define the components that the end-user will work with; components like, charts, tables, lists, and dropdowns. 
  
  Those are all visual presentation components though. You define the content that these components display by defining Knowledge Objects in the Knowledge Model; objects such as KPIs, benchmarks, variables, and filters.
  
  So you see, View and Knowledge Model can't live without each other. A View without a Knowledge Model cannot display meaningful content and a Knowledge Model cannot show itself to end-users, because it's really a collection of formulas and definitions. Only together, can View and Knowledge Model create contextual business interfaces like a Steering View or Action View.

#### 03 01 02 An Abstract Example of the Knowledge Model-View Relations...

The interactions between the Knowledge Model and the View can be a little complex to understand when you're just getting started. This is why we'd like to provide a little analogy to you. Maybe it helps you. 

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407153206.png)

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407153229.png)

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407153244.png)

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407153317.png)

![](../images/37 celonis/230407/20230407153350.png)

But… how does this help us to better understand the relationship between Knowledge Models and Views? Well, there are actually quite some connections we can draw. 

View

Adding an element

We knew we wanted to add a dog to the canvas which is a pre-configured element in Paint. Pre-configured elements are also available in Views. Here, we call those elements 'components'. You've seen a couple of those before, like a table, a chart or a KPI list.

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/3a10defb-2d93-4825-b5f6-d3b4cf5f6149/3/scormcontent/assets/5sxtWOFKC4MTOX-s_BrckbbnGg7YQbULs.png)

Knowledge Model

Selecting an available colour

Our dog is supposed to be blue. So we checked the colour palette. That's similar to adding a KPI to a View: Imagine we'd like to add the KPI "Average Days Lost". We'd need to specify such a KPI in our Knowledge Model so we can add it to the View. 

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/3a10defb-2d93-4825-b5f6-d3b4cf5f6149/3/scormcontent/assets/MpYmeIxUvUS1gJUu_DsRtMmOJrfOIq6D5.png)

Knowledge Model

Adding a new colour

Do you remember how we didn't find the correct blue shade and defined a new one using the HEX code?  Remember we'd like to add the KPI "Average Days Lost" to our View. Everything that the Knowledge Model provides though is "Average Weeks Lost". So we add "Average Days Lost" to the Knowledge Model accordingly. 

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/3a10defb-2d93-4825-b5f6-d3b4cf5f6149/3/scormcontent/assets/fxU3OIQZUPF04NEE_1o_Dk1UovHX8fduI.png)

View

Applying the new colour

Similar to when we applied the specific blue shade to the dog, we can now also reference the newly created KPI "Average Days Lost" in our View. 

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/3a10defb-2d93-4825-b5f6-d3b4cf5f6149/3/scormcontent/assets/AVoMXqkPGpXOw31a__DZ-FaqdfYOlxwHx.png)

Hopefully this example gives you a better idea of when to make changes in a View and when to adjust a Knowledge Model. With your analogy in mind, try to match the activities below correctly, as in whether you would access the Knowledge Model or rather the View to perform them.

### 03 02 Distinguishing between the Visual and YAML Editors [2:30]

Knowledge Models and Views are the only assets in Celonis Studio that - in their core - are configured using YAML, a generic data serialization language. You are familiar with YAML, right? If this is not the case yet, please make sure to invest some time in [YAML Basics](https://academy.celonis.com/courses/yaml-basics). 

You can configure Knowledge Models and Views using either the YAML Editor or the Visual Editor. But some components (in Views) and Knowledge Objects (in Knowledge Models) can only be configured using the YAML Editor. Note that we are continually working to improve the Visual Editor, so keep an eye on updates!

What is the difference between the Visual and the YAML Editor?

You might be able to answer this question yourself when you compare the screenshots below. 

KNOWLEDGE MODEL

The left picture shows the Visual Editor, the right one the YAML Editor. Both show the same Knowledge Model but a different interface to interact with. 

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/3a10defb-2d93-4825-b5f6-d3b4cf5f6149/3/scormcontent/assets/cqQx-2rab_tITg60_W5XsbNs2ngarWtKA.png)

VIEW

Again, the left picture depicts the Visual Editor while the right one shows the YAML Editor. Same View but different ways to edit it. 

![](https://scorm.eu.thoughtindustries.com/content/1cc62825-20df-4077-8216-a9df1132a5ad/3a10defb-2d93-4825-b5f6-d3b4cf5f6149/3/scormcontent/assets/e-DAhnnxQjSzbR60_taPOe7flHffzGhjQ.png)

Looking at the screenshots above, select all statements that appear to be true about the Visual and YAML Editors for Knowledge Models and Views:

- [x] The Visual Editors work according to a "What you see is what you get" principle

- [x] You can easily switch back and forth between the Visual Editor and the YAML Editor at any time

- [ ] Using the Visual Editor is easier than using the YAML Editor
