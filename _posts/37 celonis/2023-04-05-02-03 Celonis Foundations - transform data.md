## Intro

Learning Objectives

## Welcome!

Your central task in Data Integration is to build a process Data Model. To do so you first connect to systems, extract raw data, and then “transform” the extracted data.

Transforming means:

1. building one or more Activity Table(s) with all relevant process activities
2. reworking as necessary your Case Table(s) and other relevant master data tables.

Sounds cryptic? Not to worry, after this course you'll have mastered the foundations and will be able to:

- Explain what it means to transform data
- Choose the appropriate tool for transformations
- Set up transformations with Data Jobs and the Replication Cockpit
- Build your Activity table and other important tables using transformations
- Accelerate your work with templates
- Troubleshoot your transformations

Let's get started!
