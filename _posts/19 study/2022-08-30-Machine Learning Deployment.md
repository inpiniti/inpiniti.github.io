# 8주차 : Machine Learning Deployment
1. **Reading section: Revisit Machine Learning Deployment**
    - Understanding about Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning (CD4ML)
    - Read these following articles :
        - CD4ML: 
            [article](https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html)
            [article](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/getting-smart-applying-continuous-delivery-data-science-drive-car-sales) 
            [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um6Sq5EhW6A)
        - MLOps guide: 
            [article](https://mlops-for-all.github.io/docs/introduction/intro/)
            [article](https://mlops-guide.github.io/)
    - After reading articles, what kind of insights you got? Share with others !
    - If you have any good articles / books, please share it !

2. **Deploy Deep Learning Model using Flask (MNIST digit recognition)**
    - Please go to this following link: 
        [github_1](https://github.com/akashdeepjassal/mnist-flask)
        or 
        [github_2](https://github.com/Prajwal10031999/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-CNN-Flask-App-)
    - You will find a flask project for MNIST digit recognition
    - **Try to replicate that project on your local computer (you can choose one of them)**
        - Please do not clone and run the project directly
        - Instead, you can try to create each files by yourself and run.
        - **Important: Please be careful with Library dependency (check requirements.txt).** You can get many errors.
            - You may use the older version and follow the code, or
            - You may use the new version and modify some parts.
    - The goal of this task are:
        - Getting know about another type of learning approach that is deep learning
        - Getting know on deep learning structure project (i.e., what’s the difference with previous tasks)
        - Able to run the (deep learning) project and show the result to others
        - If you have any questions or problems, please share it and let’s discuss it together
    - **Curious about MNIST digit recognition?**
        - MNIST dataset :
            [article](https://tensorflowkorea.gitbooks.io/tensorflow-kr/content/g3doc/tutorials/mnist/beginners/) 
        - MNIST digit recognition : you can find a lot of article discuss the digit recognition task

3. **Share your ideas !**
    Please share your ideas for next study ! 
    What kind of **topic** for our next study ?
